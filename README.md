Basic knowledge of the mod is assumed

download by using: (press INSERT on your keyboard to paste it into the OC terminal)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ynsrkn/OC_AE2_Maintainer/main/config.lua && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ynsrkn/OC_AE2_Maintainer/main/ae2_helpers.lua && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ynsrkn/OC_AE2_Maintainer/main/level_maintainer.lua && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ynsrkn/OC_AE2_Maintainer/main/craftables.lua
```

HOW TO USE:

craftables : shows all availible crafts in the AE2 system and gives the option to generate / refresh a config.lua file with all crafts in it with (threshold = defaultThreshold, batchSize = defaultBatchSize).
default values can be edited inside the file itself with .\edit craftables.lua

config : contains an array of all maintained items with the form {"item label", threhsold, batchsize}, sleeptimer that dictates how long the program waits until it does another parse, and a shuffle mode used to enable shuffling of the items choosed for crafting, usefull for ensuring even filling of buffers and for infinite crafting

level_maintainer : executes the program with mentioned settings, will run forever and print out various info to the terminal.

IMPORTANT:

THE PROGRAM NEEDS AN INTERFACE OR A MECONTROLLER CONNECTED TO AN OC ADAPTER BLOCK.

reboot the (ingame) computer after changing / updating config.lua.
